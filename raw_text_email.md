> Safe Shopping Tips
> Amazon.com works hard to protect our customers. For your safety, when ordering items advertised by sellers other than Amazon.com:
>
> * Always place your orders directly through Amazon.com. Never send money directly to sellers through wire transfers or checks; we do not guarantee such transactions.
>
> * Beware of e-mails that request direct payments, request payment to international locations, or ask for personal information. Amazon.com will never e-mail you to pay for Marketplace transactions outside our shopping cart, or ask you to confirm personal information such as a credit card number or password via e-mail. If a particular e-mail looks suspicious or unusual, please contact us directly.
>
> Reporting suspicious activity at http://www.amazon.com/gp/css/contact-us-access/ref=sue_us will help us enhance marketplace safety and serve you better in the future.
